# funky-rust-guitar
This script was used to annoy people in the Steam game Rust by spiratically moving one's mouse curser around (Logitech G-series mice). However, I have since been banned from Rust for being crazy good with the guitar (aka the mouse movement triggered the game's anticheat) so I don't think you should use this :)
